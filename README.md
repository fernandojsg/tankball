Firefox OS 
----------------------
Tankball is now compatible with Mozilla Firefox OS so you can install it from the market place :)

External code and libraries
----------------------
It includes code from:
* `Vector2` and `stats.js` classes from [mrdoob's three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* `clock` I believe it's based also on [mrdoob's three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) but I just found it somewhere around stackoverflow
* `Font rendering` from [claudiocc's 1k notebook](http://www.claudiocc.com/the-1k-notebook-part-i/) (I added the numeric characters)
