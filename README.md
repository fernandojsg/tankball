Tank Ball
=========

Javascript version of the 3210 game

[Click here](http://kile.stravaganza.org/lab/js/tankball) to give a try :)

It includes code from:
# Vector2.js class from [mrdoob's three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
# Font rendering from [claudiocc's 1k notebook](http://www.claudiocc.com/the-1k-notebook-part-i/) (I added the numeric characters)
